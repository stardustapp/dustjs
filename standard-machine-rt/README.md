# \@dustjs/standard-machine-rt

Admittedly, this module is a pile of random files
from different stages of progress of Stardust,
just kinda pushed together into one place.

Lots of stuff needs to be refactored, fixed, or
pulled out into purpose-oriented modules.

Not really much for a third-party to use here.
Except maybe JavaScript research I guess.

## Usage
```sh
npm i --save @dustjs/standard-machine-rt
```
